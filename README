in order to compile this code you'll need

- lapack and blas being installed

- a fresh version of lime being installed

  since we are going to use c-lime in C++, please make sure that
  lime.h looks something like

#ifndef LIME_H
#define LIME_H

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif /* __cplusplus */

#include <lime_config.h>
...
#include <lime_reader.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif


There are Makefiles available where compiler options, path and
libraries need to be adjusted. You'll also need to find out whether on
your system fortran has a trailing underscore or not. This can be
controlled in the code by defining or not defining F_, e.g. via the
command line option of your c++-compiler like -DF_ for defining, and
nothing for not defining. Linux usually has an underscore.
